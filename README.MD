Installation
---------------
- copy "psnes" directory to "/switch/" directory on sdcard
- copy roms to "/switch/psnes/roms/" directory on sdcard

Information
---------------
- Simple (but cool?) ui.
- Support preview images (png), named as the rom name with png extension instead zip, in the "previews" directory (to be created if needed).
- Support save states
- Support 2x, 3x, fit, fit 4/3 and fullscreen hardware linear scaling
- Support software filtering (tv2x, smooth, supereagle, 2xsai...)
- pSNES use a database file for rom handling. You'll need a "db.xml" file located alongside the application. The current "db.xml" file comes from dat-o-matic, and contains a complete "no-intro" romset. Your rom files must be zipped and named as per this set (http://datomatic.no-intro.org). If you don't want to use a database, just remove this file.
